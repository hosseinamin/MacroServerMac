Find here some example MindExpress pages.

##Download##

The [keyboard_mac.jmm file](http://macroservermac.s3.amazonaws.com/keyboard_mac.jmm) is the jmm (MindExpress document) that you can use. 

You will also need the font ["VAG Rounded Light"](http://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Uncategorized/39723/VAGRoundedLightSSi) for this package to look how it was meant to!

Note that the [keyboard\_mac.xml](keyboard_mac.xml) for this is in this repo if you want to tweak it - or compare changes. 

##Running:##

Make sure you set your mac's IP address by editing the very first page's "On" button.

(Hit F2 to go into Edit Mode then double click on the button at the bottom left. Exit edit mode and you should be all set.)

Note that there is a shift, alt, command, control keys - these are all by default set to be "sticky" (i.e. once you hit them they stay on). It should allow you to do cool things like send Apple+shift+3. It can be difficult to keep control on the Mac though whether these are set or not. Thats why we have the notifier on the mac telling you what has just been set.

Do note there is also a standard "shift" key to upper case or get the shifted state of the keys for one press. 

If you click on the mouse symbol at the top right you will see a mouse control panel and some examples of shortcuts that are mac specific (e.g. opening spotlight and switching to the next app). You are free to edit this as much as you like!
