(MIndExpress) MacroServer for Mac
===========

A server, and set of modules for listening to a MindExpress client and controlling a mac.


Dependencies
------------

Depending on your platform, you will need the following python modules for this to function:

  * Mac - Quartz

How to get started
------------------

Run the server

    ./MacroServerMac.py

It will now listen for any calls in on the MindExpress port

Problems/To-Do
------------------

* Some of the key-mapping is wrong. Please fix the KeyCodes.csv for the correct mapping
* Multi-platform code (will need combining with PyUserInput when that project is working nicely with keyboards)
* Allow from IP/Range
* Sticky_key functionality (having a mind block here)
* Window control code

Many thanks to
